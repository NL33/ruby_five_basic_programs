Some basic programs written in Ruby for practice purposes. Programs are generally thorough, but not fully tested/perfected in interest of time:

1) numbers_in_words: converts entered numbers to their english written equivalents (e.g., user enters "1,001", program returns "One Thousand One").  Valid through < 10 trillion.

2) calculator_in_words: converts written out request for calculation to its numerical answer (e.g., user enters "What is 100 plus 60?", program returns "160").

3) legacy_data: rearranges data presented as a hash with arrays into a hash where each element is linked with the original key. (Simple rendering for instructive purposes.)

4) title_case: converts entered words/phrases/sentences into the "title case" version of them (ie, "the story of a great and kind gentleman" converts to "The Story of a Great and Kind Gentleman").

5) fizz_buzz: user enters a number, and program returns numbers from 1 to that number, except for any integer divisible by 3, prints "fizz", any integer divisible by 5, prints "buzz", any integer divisible by 3 and 5 prints "fizzbuzz".
